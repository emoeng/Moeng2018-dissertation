Moeng Dissertation Data Archive

Author: Emily Moeng

This repository contains all stimuli, data, and analysis script codes used in Moeng 2018, "The Acquisition of Phonetic Categories" (dissertation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)

This includes the following:
	-Experimental stimuli:
		-Stimuli_Experiment A1
		-Stimuli_Experiment A3-and-ExperimentA3Tone
		-Stimuli_Experiment B (divided into 3 parts)
		-Stimuli_Experiment C1
		-Stimuli_Experiment C2
	-Analysis scripts (analysis done in R):
		-Analysis-ExpA.R
		-Analysis-ExpB-PhoneTest.R
		-Analysis-ExpB-RuleTest.R
		-Analysis-ExpC.R
	-Participant data for all experiments
		-data-A1 (data6).xlsx
		-data-A2 (data4).xlsx
		-data-A2-Tone (data5).xlsx
		-data-A3 (data8).xlsx
		-data-A3-Tone (data9).xlsx
		-data-B (origC3).xlsx
		-data-C1 (origB1).xlsx
		-data-C2 (origB2).xlsx
		-data-pilot (data3).xlsx
Stimuli for Experiments A2 and A2-Tone are not included, as these stimuli are owned by Jessica Maye and LouAnn Gerken, who graciously let me use them. Stimuli were originally used in Maye and Gerken (2001) "Learning phonemes: How far can the input take us"

A NOTE REGARDING EXPERIMENT NAMES
There were 3 names used for each experiment: the original name used when I was running the experiments, the analysisName (used in analysis scripts and some early dissertation drafts), and the final name as stated in the dissertation. Since analysis scripts may make use of earlier names that did not make it into the dissertation, all names are provided below for reference.
